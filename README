A Ruby framework for Reinforcement Learning.

TODO:
Create a factory for creating state machines with particular features, such as
n-armed bandits or schedules of reinforcement.

* Decide if actions on state machines should be invoked via state objects or
state names.  Have to remember that want agent to be able to interact with a state
machine without having access to all information contained in a state and in an
action.  But perhaps the Environment object will take care of this, acting as the
bridge that hides information appropriately.
